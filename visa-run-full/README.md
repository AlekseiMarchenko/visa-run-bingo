# Visa Run Bingo – Full Version

This project contains the full front‑end implementation of the Visa Run Bingo web application.  It includes a bingo‑style game grid, a task list for unlocking cities, a simple quiz, and integration hooks for a Telegram WebApp backend.

## Development

To run the development server locally:

```bash
cd visa-run-full
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will start at `http://localhost:5173`.  You can edit the files in the `src/` directory and the browser will automatically reload.

## Build

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized assets will be emitted to the `dist/` directory.  These files can be served by any static web server or deployed to a platform such as Render.
