# Visa Run Bingo – Version 2

This folder contains the source code for **Visa Run Bingo – Version 2**, a fun quiz‑style web game built with React and Vite. It serves as a standalone front‑end that can be deployed as a static site.

## Development

To run the development server locally:

```bash
cd visa-run-v2
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be served at `http://localhost:5173` by default. You can edit the source files under `src/` and the browser will live‑reload.

## Build

To build a production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled assets will be emitted to the `dist/` directory, ready to be served by a static web host.
